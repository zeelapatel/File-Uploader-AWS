# Cloud-Based File Upload Service

## Overview
This project is a cloud-based file upload service using various AWS (Amazon Web Services) components. The architecture of this service is designed to be scalable and secure.

## Architecture
The service uses the following AWS components:
- **AWS Lambda**: A serverless compute service that processes the uploaded files.
- **Amazon S3**: An object storage service used for storing uploaded files.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Manages incoming requests from clients.
- **AWS DynamoDB**: A NoSQL database to store metadata or logs related to file uploads.
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Provides an isolated section of the AWS cloud where resources are launched in a defined virtual network.
- **Subnet**: A range of IP addresses in your VPC.

## Usage
Clients can interact with the service through an interface that requires the user's files, name, and email address. Clients must also accept the license agreement before uploading files.
